## üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a summary of the tech stack used in this project:
| Name | Version | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| [PHP](https://www.php.net/) | 8.0.25 (Webetu restriction) | We use PHP for the backend of our application and also the frontend (at least HTML is generated via PHP). It manages our authentication system, our database connection and the different pages of our application |
| [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) | 5 | We use HTML to structure the pages of our application, as it is required for a web application. We tried to follow a pretty logical structure in terms of semantics so that our website is accessible to everyone. |
| [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) | 3 | We used CSS to style our pages. We thought about using some utility-driven CSS framework, like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), but we decided to stick to a more traditional approach since Tailwind felt a bit overkill. |
| [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) | 10.5 | We use MariaDB as our database, since it is the database used for Webetu. It is a fork of MySQL, which is a relational database management system. We use it to store our users' data, as well as the episodes and series they watch, their bookmarks, etc. |
| [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) | 2.4.6 (Webetu restriction) | We use Apache as our web server, since it is the web server used for Webetu. When deploying our app on Webetu, we configured our .htaccess file to only allow requests to our index.php file (which is the entry point of our application) and the assets directory which contains series |
