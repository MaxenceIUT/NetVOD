## üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a summary of the tech stack used in this project:
| Name | Version | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| [PHP](https://www.php.net/) | 8.0.25 (Webetu restriction) | PHP is used for the backend of our application. It generates the HTML based on the page the user is on. |
| [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) | 5 | HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. The HTML structure of our application follows semantic rules, to ensure a good SEO and accessibility. |
| [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) | 3 | CSS is the standard choice when it comes to styling a web page. We thought about using some utility-driven CSS framework, like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), but we decided to stick to a more traditional approach since Tailwind felt a bit overkill for the size of our website. |
| [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) | 5.5.68 | MariaDB is the database used on Webetu which is why we had to stick with it. It stores our users' data, as well as the episodes and series they watch, their bookmarks, etc. |
| [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) | 2.4.6 (Webetu restriction) | Apache is the web server used on Webetu. When deploying our app on Webetu, we configured our .htaccess file to only allow requests to our index.php file (which is the entry point of our application) and the assets directory which contains series. That way, we can't access any other file on the server such as the database credentials or the source code. |
